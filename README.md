# 🎬 MoviesStore – A Simple Django Web App

MoviesStore is a beginner-friendly Django project designed to showcase basic Django functionality such as user authentication (signup & login) and homepage routing.
The project is organized into modular apps – `accounts` for user management and `home` for the main landing page or future movie-related features.

This project is perfect for learning the Django project structure, working with templates, and customizing forms.
